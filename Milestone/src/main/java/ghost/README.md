The extension I did is soda can.
soda can is represented as 's' symbol on the map.
It has less 'power' than superfruit
so if waka eats superfruit, then eats a soda.
if the effect of superfruit has not been finished, the soda will have no effect.
Also, if soda drinks a soda, then eat a superfruit when soda is in effect,
the superfruit effect will override soda effect.
And, of course, soda is not like coffee, 
its effect will not get extended if you drink twice in a row.
